## Setting up the Project Locally

To run this project locally you will need to create two '.env' files: '.env.development' and '.env.test'. Into each file, add the necessary environment variables to connect to the development and test databases. This can be achieved by adding PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).
